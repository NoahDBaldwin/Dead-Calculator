<h1>Dead Calculator</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I took a basic calculator and started by adding some extra funcitons to it. It can disable even and/or odd numbers on the calculator. Then I made it so that it originally starts off not working. There are no batteries in in and you need to put the batteries in the calculator by flipping it over and unscrewing the backside. Once they are in, the calculator functions normally.
